      <h1>Welcome to Remote Labs</h1>
      <p>Remote labs, also known as online laboratories or web-based laboratories, are digital platforms that enable users to access and control real laboratory equipment and instruments remotely via the internet. Unlike virtual labs that simulate experiments digitally, remote labs offer direct interaction with physical equipment located in a laboratory or research facility. This innovative approach to experimental learning and scientific exploration provides numerous benefits, making remote labs increasingly popular in educational institutions, research centers, and industrial settings.</p>
